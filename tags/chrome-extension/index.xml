&lt;p>At the beginning, we used a pure HTML, CSS, and TypeScript architecture. This was a logical decision, as less than 40% of the extension&amp;rsquo;s code is UI-related, and none of us were familiar with frontend frameworks. This approach also avoided the added complexity of state management libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this design, the file running as the content script (which we called &lt;code>content&lt;/code>) imports other files to perform its tasks, including the UI component (which we called &lt;code>interviewTab&lt;/code>). &lt;code>interviewTab&lt;/code> exports functions that change the UI&amp;rsquo;s appearance, and the state is managed in &lt;code>content&lt;/code>. This worked well when the UI was simple and indeed shortened development time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[SyntaxNext] Project Introduction</title><link>https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/posts/syntaxnext/1-intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:27:11 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/posts/syntaxnext/1-intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone. This is a new series about what I learned while developing our side project, SyntaxNext.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-syntaxnext-does">What SyntaxNext Does&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>SyntaxNext is an AI-powered mock interview agent. It works as a Chrome extension, and users can choose any LeetCode problem. During the interview, the extension shows the stages and tasks that an interviewee should complete. The agent will describe the question, and users should tell the agent how they plan to solve the problem. Users can go to the next step only when the agent thinks they have finished the required tasks in the current step.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
