What SyntaxNext Does
SyntaxNext is an AI-powered mock interview agent. It works as a Chrome extension, and users can choose any LeetCode problem. During the interview, the extension shows the stages and tasks that an interviewee should complete. The agent will describe the question, and users should tell the agent how they plan to solve the problem. Users can go to the next step only when the agent thinks they have finished the required tasks in the current step."><meta name=author content="Chang-Yu Huang"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/main.min.css><link rel=preload as=image href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/theme.png><link rel=preload as=image href=img/oct.JPG><link rel=preload as=image href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/github.svg><script defer src=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/img/cloud.JPG><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.139.3"><meta itemprop=name content="[SyntaxNext] Project Introduction"><meta itemprop=description content="Hi everyone.

This is a new series about what I learned while developing our side project, SyntaxNext.</p><h1 id=what-syntaxnext-does>What SyntaxNext Does</h1><p>SyntaxNext is an AI-powered mock interview agent. It works as a Chrome extension, and users can choose any LeetCode problem. During the interview, the extension shows the stages and tasks that an interviewee should complete. The agent will describe the question, and users should tell the agent how they plan to solve the problem. Users can go to the next step only when the agent thinks they have finished the required tasks in the current step.</p><p>After users finish their code and the agent approves the solution, they can submit their code to LeetCode, just like we always do. If everything goes well and the interview is done, users receive an evaluation of their performance.</p><h1 id=project-architecture>Project Architecture</h1><p>We did some research before starting development and found no similar products on the web. Most mock interview services are for behavioral interviews or other types.</p><p>Developing this project was harder than we predicted. For example, writing a functional content script requires a full understanding of LeetCode&rsquo;s behavior in different components. We divided the project into four components/microservices:</p><ol><li>extension,</li><li>agent,</li><li>speech-to-text, and</li><li>login.
Except for the extension, these components can be reused for new types of user interfaces.</li></ol><h1 id=chrome-extension>Chrome Extension</h1><p>Based on Manifest V3, a Chrome extension is composed of:</p><ol><li>content script(s): script(s) that are inserted into specific pages,</li><li>offscreen(s): invisible pages,</li><li>service worker: a temporary worker for the extension,</li><li>popup: a popup page,</li><li>manifest: a settings file.</li></ol><p>An extension can only contain some of these components. For example, we only use 1, 3, and 5.</p><h2 id=user-media>User Media</h2><p>Our agent interacts with users by <em>voice</em>. Users&rsquo; voices are processed by a <strong>speech-to-text (STT)</strong> service. To capture the voice, we have to get permission to use the device&rsquo;s microphone, which can be done by the <code>getUserMedia</code> interface. However, if it is called on a LeetCode page, what users will see is &ldquo;LeetCode is asking for the permission,&rdquo; which is not what we want.</p><p>To create a warning popup with our application&rsquo;s name, we have to create a page whose source is the Chrome extension itself. The popup meets the requirement, but we want it to be invisible. On the other hand, although an offscreen document is invisible, a warning in it won&rsquo;t appear on the current user page. Eventually, we used an iframe inserted by the content script. The iframe is invisible, and because of Chrome&rsquo;s logic, its source is the extension.</p><h2 id=websocket-connection>WebSocket Connection</h2><p>In the early design, the agent could send a message to the extension when the user was not speaking for a long time to check what the user was thinking. This feature was postponed and, in fact, can also be satisfied by a traditional HTTP request (by setting a timeout in the frontend). Furthermore, the requirements of STT pushed us to use WebSockets.</p><p>But where should we build the connection? In the official documentation, Google suggests using the service worker. However, the service worker could be unloaded if no event happens for a period of time. The inserted iframe seems like the best choice.</p><p>(Actually, the WebSocket to the agent is unnecessary. <code>LangGraph</code> can be stateless by using a thread ID and state. Hence, RESTful APIs are totally practicable and would obtain higher scalability. Nevertheless, changing the current implementation is too time-consuming, and there aren&rsquo;t that many users for now.)</p><h2 id=interaction-with-leetcode>Interaction with LeetCode</h2><p>Since the extension is based on LeetCode, it has to get information from the page and change some behavior. The three most noteworthy cases are code pad fetching, submit button rewriting, and tab replacement.</p><p>The straightforward method to get the code pad content is to read the HTML content. But because the code pad component that LeetCode uses (<code>Monaco</code>) only creates elements that are shown on screen, fetching long code is hard. Though Monaco provides an API to get the code content, the runtime of the content script and LeetCode&rsquo;s JavaScript is different, so we can&rsquo;t get the <code>Monaco</code> object. The solution is to insert a script element into the LeetCode HTML. The script listens to window messages, fetches the code, and then replies once there is a request.</p><p>The redirection after code submission is another issue. It breaks the integrity of the user experience. The Chrome extension provides several ways to block redirection, but they don&rsquo;t work on those invoked by React. We have to write a new listener that submits, polls the result, and notifies the agent when clicked.</p><p>LeetCode uses React on its pages, which prevents us from appending a new tab to the current layout. So, we have to accept the second plan: changing the content of an existing tab. We chose the Solution tab. Surprisingly, React doesn&rsquo;t change the content back even if we focus on another tab and then go back. This is an interesting insight, but since I haven&rsquo;t done research on it, we can make this a future topic.</p><h1 id=next>Next</h1><p>I will talk about how I used React combined with normal TypeScript in the next article.</p></section><footer class="mt-12 flex flex-wrap"><a class="mb-1.5 ltr:mr-1.5 rtl:ml-1.5 rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] px-5 py-1 no-underline hover:bg-black/[6%] dark:bg-white/[8%] dark:hover:bg-white/[12%]" href=https://jack2012aa.github.io/CYH-blog/tags/chrome-extension>Chrome Extension</a>
